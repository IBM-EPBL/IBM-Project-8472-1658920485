Efficient Water Quality Analysis &amp; Prediction using Machine Learning

Water is considered as a vital resource that affects various aspects of human 
health and lives. The quality of water is a major concern for people living in urban 
areas. The quality of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and 
a foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. Water 
Quality Index (WQI) assessment is required for the purpose of public health. In 
this project, an effective linear regression model is developed to predict the WQI 
based on the parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, Turbidity,
Nitrates and fecal coliform. So this project aims at building a Machine Learning 
(ML) model to Predict Water Quality by considering all water quality standard 
indicators.
